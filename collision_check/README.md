# collision_check

This is a simple Arduino library that detects collisions between multiple objects. Useful when you start creating simple games in Arduino.

How it works: You pass the x coordinate, y coordinate, width, and height for two objects. The library returns a true if they are colliding and false if they are not. You can call multiple objects if you want to detect collision between more than two objects.

To install, simply download and extract into your library folder for Arduino.  You can then find collision_check under examples.
